# 100% Reliable LLM Outputs with Structured Data Outputs (Developer Tutorial)

## Overview

Creating reliable, enterprise-grade AI applications requires strongly-typed, validated data objects to ensure downstream systems can trust the data generated by LLMs. However, unprocessed LLM outputs are often unreliable and unpredictable. This tutorial shows you how to harness structured response outputs to achieve 100% consistency for your AI-powered solutions.

This repository serves as a companion to the PydanticAI Masterclass and its third video tutorial **[100% Reliable LLM Outputs with Structured Data Outputs (Developer Tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXO9_nWZYrc)** which introduces the `result_type` parameter through practical examples.
